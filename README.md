Chat-Room-Server

A chat room server that works with my Chat-Room-Client.
Uses threads and stream sockets so that many clients can be online and send messages to either all online clients or to a specific online user.

HOW TO START
Port 2000 is default. To use another port, start Server.jar in command line and write port number at the end, for example 5000:
"java -jar Server.jar 5000"
